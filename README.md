- 😛 Hi, my name is Nicoe and yes my name is without the letter "L". How to pronounce it? It's "Ni-Koh"
- ⛰️ I love nature and I want to hike again soon! 
- 🌱 I’m interested in Health & Technology
- 🥸 Fun fact: I love puzzles and to this day I am not done with it. I like it when the challenge is challenging me.
